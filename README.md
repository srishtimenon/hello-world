# hello-world
My first repository. 
Hopefully some human beings other than me and bots navigating the wonderour expanse of the world wide web will find this. On the other hand once I (hopefully) get better at this, I might regret saying that. Here's to hoping I learn enough to cringe at this pretty soon. This felt like introducing myself at a new school which I think we can all agree is a terrifying experience. So if I'm not active for a while I'm probably just recovering from doing this. (ps - I wonder what moon tacos taste like.)
